# SPHERE: Secure Peer-to-Peer Hosted Encryption Record Exchange

## Overview
SPHERE (Secure Peer-to-Peer Hosted Encryption Record Exchange) is a blockchain-powered platform designed to give users total control over their contact information and communications. It enables users to securely store contact data on the blockchain, share it selectively, and allow encrypted messaging that ensures only the intended recipient can access the content.

SPHERE also empowers developers to build innovative applications on top of its blockchain, fostering a decentralized ecosystem for social interactions and data management.

## Features
- **User-Centric Data Privacy**:
  - Store contact information securely on the blockchain.
  - Control access to your data with customizable permissions.

- **End-to-End Encrypted Messaging**:
  - Enable trusted contacts to send you fully encrypted messages.
  - Messages are stored securely and can only be decrypted by the intended recipient.

- **Application Ecosystem**:
  - Allow developers to build apps that interact with SPHERE's blockchain.
  - Enable seamless migration of followers and connections across platforms.

- **Verification Without Access**:
  - Verify data integrity using cryptographic hashes without exposing the actual content.

- **Freedom of Speech and Security**:
  - Ensure messages remain encrypted outside third-party platforms, maintaining privacy and freedom of expression.

## Architecture
SPHERE is composed of several key modules:

1. **Blockchain Layer**:
   - Serves as the foundation for storing contact information and encrypted messages.
   - Provides a decentralized, immutable ledger for all operations.

2. **Access Control Module**:
   - Manages permissions for who can view or interact with your data.
   - Implements secure sharing mechanisms to enforce user-defined rules.

3. **Encryption Framework**:
   - Handles all cryptographic operations, including encryption, decryption, and digital signature generation.
   - Modules include:
     - **KeyGenerator**: Generates secure cryptographic keys.
       - File: `KeyGenerator.cs`
     - **SignatureGenerator**: Creates digital signatures to validate data authenticity.
       - File: `SignatureGenerator.cs`
     - **Encryption**: Performs encryption and decryption operations.
       - File: `Encryption.cs`

4. **Integration Layer**:
   - Provides APIs and tools for developers to build applications on top of SPHERE.
   - Ensures compatibility with third-party platforms while maintaining data security.

## Usage

1. **Secure Contact Management**:
   - Store and share your contact information securely on the blockchain.

2. **Encrypted Communication**:
   - Enable selected contacts to send messages that only you can decrypt.

3. **Application Development**:
   - Utilize SPHERE's blockchain for building decentralized applications with integrated contact and messaging functionality.

4. **Data Integrity Verification**:
   - Verify the integrity of contact data using cryptographic hashes without exposing sensitive information.
