# SPHERE Project

Welcome to the SPHERE Project repository! 

SPHERE (Secure Peer-to-Peer Hosted Encryption Record Exchange) is a robust framework designed for secure, decentralized communication and data sharing. The framework prioritizes user privacy, data integrity, and seamless encryption management while allowing for versatile application development.

---
## (Active Work in Progress)

## Features

### 1. **Secure Contact List Management**
- Unified contact management across all applications built on the SPHERE framework.
- Users have full control over their contact information and can modify it as needed.
- Peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture ensures data is not stored on centralized servers.

### 2. **End-to-End Encryption**
- All communications are encrypted using robust algorithms, ensuring privacy and security.
- Each communication session uses unique, dynamically generated keys.

### 3. **Decentralized Networking**
- Utilizes a Distributed Hash Table (DHT) for node discovery and data exchange.
- Eliminates single points of failure and enhances system resilience.

### 4. **Modular Design**
- Highly extensible with components for encryption, authentication, and data handling.
- Developers can easily add new features or adapt the framework to specific use cases.

### 5. **Digital Signature Verification**
- Ensures the integrity and authenticity of messages and files exchanged.
- Prevents tampering and verifies sender identity.

### 6. **Built-in Encryption Record Management**
- Encryption records are securely stored and shared only with authorized parties.
- Prevents unauthorized access and data leaks.

### 7. **High Scalability**
- Optimized for performance, even in large-scale, distributed environments.
- Lightweight components ensure low resource consumption.

## Technical Breakdown

### Core Components

#### 1. **Distributed Hash Table (DHT)**
The DHT is the backbone of the SPHERE network, providing efficient node discovery and data exchange. Each node maintains a local table of other nodes, enabling:
- Fast lookup of peers and resources.
- Redundancy through distributed storage.

#### 2. **Encryption Module**
The `Encryption.cs` file contains:
- Symmetric encryption for message confidentiality.
- Asymmetric encryption for key exchange and authentication.
- A hybrid approach that combines the strengths of both.

#### 3. **Digital Signature System**
Implemented in `SignatureGenerator.cs`:
- Generates and verifies cryptographic signatures.
- Protects data integrity and authenticates communication origins.

#### 4. **Packet Management**
- `Packet.cs`: Defines the structure of data packets used in communication.
- `PacketBuilder.cs` and `PacketReader.cs`: Handle serialization and deserialization of packets, ensuring efficient data exchange.

#### 5. **Credential and Key Management**
- `CredentialManager.cs` ensures secure handling of user credentials.
- `KeyGenerator.cs` dynamically generates cryptographic keys for secure sessions.

#### 6. **Node and Client Management**
- `Node.cs`: Defines the core behavior of SPHERE nodes, including message routing and data storage.
- `Client.cs`: Manages client interactions, providing an interface for user applications to interact with the network.

#### 7. **Block Contact System**
- `BlockContact.cs`: Implements a mechanism for storing contact info in a secure way and provide access only to those with provided access.

### Security Features

#### End-to-End Encryption
- Ensures that only intended recipients can decrypt messages.
- Uses ephemeral session keys to minimize the risk of long-term key exposure.

#### Secure Key Exchange
- Diffie-Hellman key exchange for secure initial handshake.
- Keys are never transmitted in plaintext, ensuring confidentiality.

#### Authentication and Integrity
- Digital signatures verify the sender's identity and ensure data has not been tampered with.
- Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC) provides an additional layer of integrity.

#### Resistance to Attacks
- Decentralized architecture mitigates risks associated with single points of failure.
- Replay attacks are prevented through timestamped messages and nonce usage.
